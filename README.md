beyondAbstraction
=================
This repo is an excellent exercise to see how far a bad comprehension of abstraction and design patterns can take you.
By all means don't take this repository serious. If you learn anything here let it be what not to do.

If you have a good look at the code you will see that is has been abstracted so far that it becomes unreadable rubish. 
This should remind us that we write algorithms. Algorithms that are readable to humans. 

Many have resorted to creating abstract mumblings in a feable attempt to create DRY code. They succeeded at the DRY part 
but few will successfully build on this flagranted bunch of misery.

Remember to always keep as close to your pseudo code as possible.
